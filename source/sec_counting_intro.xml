    <title>Introduction to Counting</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            It may seem silly at first to have an entire chapter dedicated to the topic of counting at this stage of your mathematical development. After all, how hard could it be?
        </p>

    <investigation xml:id="inv-counting">
        <introduction>
            Let's consider a few "counting problems" to get a better sense of what may actually be involved in this seemingly simple task of counting.

                <p>
                    While we could also approach this question by enumerating the individual dots, another approach uses a concept called <term>subitizing</term>. This particular arrangement of dots is common and familiar to anyone who has played games that involve rolling a die. So we recognize this particular arrangement of dots and associate it with prior knowledge that there are five dots.

        <task xml:id="inv-count-by-multiplying">
            <statement>
                Tommy has 4 pants and 6 shirts. How many different outfits can he make from these?
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Since an outfit consists of a pants and a shirt, we need to count the number of ways we can pair each pants with each shirt. This gives us <m>4 \cdot 6 = 24</m> possible outfits.
                </p>

        <conclusion>
            <p>
                As we can see from these solutions, there are various counting strategies that can be applied depending on the situation. This chapter will introduce four fundamental strategies for counting:
